<h1>Requirements and install</h1>

<p align="justify">To use the platform in an environment that interprets the Python language, simply use the following command:</p>

```python
pip install PARE-TOOLBOX
```
<h1>Files structure</h1>

<p align="justify">Let's use the example of building a problem in PAREpy, considering the use of the Jupyter notebook. Thus, the basic file structure of the library should be as follows:</p>

```cmd
 .
 └── problem_directory
       └── of_file.py
       └── example_main.ipynb
       └── other files
```
<p align="justify">The <code>of_file.py</code> file should contain the objective function of the problem. The <code>example.ipynb</code> file is the file that will contain the call to the main function and other settings necessary for the use of the algorithm. Below we describe in more detail what each file should receive as an input variable. The algorithm structure can be represented by Figure <a href="#fig11">1.1</a>.</p>
