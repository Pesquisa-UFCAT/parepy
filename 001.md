<h1>Requirements and install</h1>

<p align="justify">The PAREPY library has a number of dependencies. To install them, simply run the <code>requirements.txt</code> file in the interpreter's command line:</p>

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<p align="justify">To use the platform in an environment that interprets the Python language, simply use the following command:</p>

```python
pip install PARE-TOOLBOX
```

<h1>Files structure</h1>

<p align="justify">Let's use the example of building a problem in PAREpy, considering the use of the Jupyter notebook. Thus, the basic file structure of the library should be as follows:</p>

```cmd
 .
 └── problem_directory
       └── of_file.py
       └── example.ipynb
```

<p align="justify">The <code>of_file.py</code> file should contain the objective function of the problem to which the concept of random variables should be applied. The <code>example.ipynb</code> file is the file that will contain the call to the main function and other settings necessary for the use of the algorithm. Below we describe in more detail what each file should receive as an input variable.</p>

<h1><code>of_file.py</code></h1>

<p align="justify">
]In this section, we will describe the of_file file and its characteristics. The of_file file should contain a def function that takes the following data as input. It is also important to note that any libraries used in this function should be imported in the file header.</p>
