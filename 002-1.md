<p align="justify">This topic explores the Monte Carlo method for estimating the value of \(\pi\) using random numbers. <br><br>

Considering a circle inscribed in a square with a side length of 2, where \(r\) is the circle's radius. \(\pi\) is given by equation <a href="#eq1">(1)</a>.</p>

<table border = "0" style = "width: 100%;">
  <tr>
    <td align = "left" style = "width: 90%;">\[\pi = \frac{A}{r^2}\]</td>
    <td align = "right" style = "width: 10%;"><p id = "eq1">(1)</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p align="justify">Using a random concept we can distributed points in the square space. Each point is defined by a pair of coordinates \((x, y)\), where \(x\) and \(y\) are independent random variables uniformly distributed on the interval \([-1, 1]\). The Figure <a href="#fig11">(1)</a>  shows this process.</p>

<p align = "left" id = "fig11"><b>Figure 1.1</b> \(\pi\) problem representation.</p>
<center><img src = "assets/images/pi_problem.svg" width = "60%"></center>

<p align="justify">To estimate the value of \(\pi\), the number of these random points falling inside the inscribed circle and the number falling outside it are counted. The estimate is given by equation <a href="#eq2">(2)</a> where \(N_{inside}\) represents the number of points inside de circle, and \(N\) is a total of random points.</p>

<table border = "0" style = "width: 100%;">
  <tr>
    <td align = "left" style = "width: 90%;">\[\pi \approx \frac{N_{inside}}{N}\]</td>
    <td align = "right" style = "width: 10%;"><p id = "eq2">(1)</p></td>

In the case of this inscribed circle, the radius is equal to half of the side length of the square, i.e., r = 1. Given the above, a large number of uniformly distributed random points are generated within the square. .  The ratio between the number of points inside the circle and the total number of generated points is precisely the probability of a point being inside the circle, which corresponds to an estimate for the ratio of areas between the circle and the square, as given by Equation (2), where A is the favorable event for points inside the circle and Ω is the sample space in question:

$$
P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(Ω)}
\tag{2}
$$

Since the area of the square is given by Equation (3), the estimate for π can be calculated by multiplying this ratio by 4.

$$
A = (2r)^2
\tag{3}
$$
