# Monte Carlo Method

The Monte Carlo method is a statistical technique that uses random sampling to estimate numerical results.
The central idea of the Monte Carlo method is to randomly generate a large number of samples from a particular process or system, and then use these samples to estimate properties or behaviors of the system as a whole.
The method can be better explained through the following steps:

1. Problem definition: First, it is necessary to have clarity about the problem or property that one wants to estimate.
2. Problem modeling: Next, it is necessary to construct a mathematical model of the problem. This involves defining the variables involved, the relationships between them, and the underlying assumptions.
3. Generation of random samples: The next step is to generate random samples that are representative of the studied system. The samples are generated according to relevant probability distributions, using methods such as pseudo-random numbers or random number sequences.
4. Calculation of estimates: With the random samples at hand, calculations or simulations can be performed based on the mathematical model to estimate the desired property or result. This may involve averaging the sampled values, the proportion of samples that satisfy certain conditions, among other statistical methods.
5. Analysis of results: After calculating the estimates, it is important to analyze the obtained results, including the variability and accuracy of the estimates. Confidence intervals and measures of uncertainty can be calculated to provide information about the reliability of the estimates.

The Monte Carlo method is particularly useful when problems are complex or cannot be easily solved by traditional analytical methods. It allows obtaining numerical approximations for results that are difficult to calculate directly.

#### Application of the Monte Carlo method: Estimating the value of π

Considering a circle inscribed in a square with a side length of 2, the area of the circle is given by Equation (1), where r is the radius of the circle.

$$
A = πr^2
\tag{1}
$$


In the case of this inscribed circle, the radius is equal to half of the side length of the square, i.e., r = 1. Given the above, a large number of uniformly distributed random points are generated within the square. Each point is defined by a pair of coordinates (x, y), where x and y are random values in the interval [-1, 1]. To estimate the value of π, the number of these random points falling inside the inscribed circle and the number falling outside it are counted. The ratio between the number of points inside the circle and the total number of generated points is precisely the probability of a point being inside the circle, which corresponds to an estimate for the ratio of areas between the circle and the square, as given by Equation (2), where A is the favorable event for points inside the circle and Ω is the sample space in question:

$$
P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(Ω)}
\tag{2}
$$

Since the area of the square is given by Equation (3), the estimate for π can be calculated by multiplying this ratio by 4.

$$
A = (2r)^2
\tag{3}
$$
