<h1>State Limite Function, Safety margin and Cornell index/h1>

<p align="justify">In this section, the basic concepts of the reliability evaluation of a structure are presented. The Monte Carlo method, the reliability procedure employed in the analyses, are presented.
<br><br>
The basic reliability problem is represented by the multiple integral of equation (1), where \(p_f\) represents the failure probability of the structure, \(X\) is the n-dimensional vector representing the random variables of the system, \(f_x(x)\) represents the joint probability density function over the failure domain, and \(G(X)\) is the limit state equation.  \(G(X) â‰¤ 0\) represents a failure condition.
